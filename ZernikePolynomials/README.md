This folder contains scripts for numerical calculation of Zernike's polynomials, their sum, reconstruction of their sum
from the images acquired by the Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor. 
For details about the calculations, refer to the source code, all relevant links should be specified there. 
The source of equations for wavefront reconstruction - the thesis authored by J. Antonello 
(https://doi.org/10.4233/uuid:f98b3b8f-bdb8-41bb-8766-d0a15dae0e27). The source of pictures for reconstruction - 
from the repository https://github.com/jacopoantonello/mshwfs there are licensed by using GPLv3.

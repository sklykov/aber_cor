# aber_cor
Collection of Python scripts for reconstruction and estimation of optical aberrations. 

It consists of two folders up to now, in one there are files for calculation of Zernike polynomials sums for representing 
a phase front, reconstruction of wafefronts using the equations from the thesis by J. Antonello 
(https://doi.org/10.4233/uuid:f98b3b8f-bdb8-41bb-8766-d0a15dae0e27). 
Another one - collection of scripts for controlling sCMOS camera, providing interface for specification of Zernike's polynomials 
amplitudes and their sum representation for the user. 
The license selection was also inspired by the usage of information from the repository https://github.com/jacopoantonello/mshwfs 
licensed also by using GPLv3.
I would be happy if some parts of this repository will be useful for anyone.

Collection of Python scripts for reconstruction and estimation of optical aberrations. 

- A few script there focus on calculation and representation of Zernike polynomials sums and subsequent
superposed phase fronts. Another - on controlling specific sCMOS camera, performing wavefront reconstruction using
open algorithms.  
- All scripts have been developed with common dependencies for numerical calculations: scipy(numpy),
matplotlib, scikit-image (skimage), pyqt5, pyqtgraph and, additionally, device controlling libraries.
I don't see any necessity to specify it now in any "requirements" file for installation from a scratch. In the case of 
any interest, please, refer to import sections of the scripts.
